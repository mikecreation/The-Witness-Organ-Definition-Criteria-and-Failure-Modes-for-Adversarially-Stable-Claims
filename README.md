**What it does:** Defines when a claim becomes *adversarially stable*.  
**Core idea:** A Witness Organ maps (claim, records, admissible challenges) to (surviving claim, stability margin, failure class) via boundary rules, inference, challenge, precision governance, and stabilization.  
**Why it matters:** Agreement and records are not enough. Claims must survive structured attempts to break them.
